    "The first step is to get a file object. The way to do this is to use the `open` function. The format is `file_object = open(filename, mode)` where `file_object` is the variable to put the file object, `filename` is a string with the filename, and `mode` is either `\"r\"` to **r**ead a file or `\"w\"` to **w**rite a file. Next the file object's functions can be called. The two most common functions are `read` and `write`. The `write` function adds a string to the end of the file. The `read` function reads the next thing in the file and returns it as a string. If no argument is given it will return the whole file (as done in the example).\n",

Next, it goes through and creates a line for each of the phone numbers with the command `out_file.write(x+\",\"+numbers[x]+\"\\n\")`. This writes out a line that contains the name, a comma, the number and follows it by a newline.\n",

    "The loading portion is a little more complicated. It starts by getting a file object. Then, it uses a while True: loop to keep looping until a `break` statement is encountered. Next, it gets a line with the line in\\_line = in\\_file.readline(). The `readline` function will return a empty string (len(string) == 0) when the end of the file is reached. The `if` statement checks for this and `break`s out of the `while` loop when that happens. Of course if the `readline` function did not return the newline at the end of the line there would be no way to tell if an empty string was an empty line or the end of the file so the newline is left in what `readline` returns. Hence we have to get rid of the newline. The line `in_line = in_line[:-1]` does this for us by dropping the last character. Next the line `[name, number] = string.split(in_line, \",\")` splits the line at the comma into a name and a number. This is then added to the `numbers` dictionary.\n",
