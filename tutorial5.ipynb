    "By now if you have been messing around with the programs you have probably found that sometimes the program does something you didn't want it to do. This is fairly common. Debugging is the process of figuring out what the computer is doing and then getting it to do what you want it to do. This can be tricky. I once spent nearly a week tracking down and fixing a bug that was caused by someone putting an x where a y should have been.\n",

    "The first thing to do (this sounds obvious) is to figure out what the\n",
    "program should be doing if it is running correctly. Come up with some\n",
    "test cases and see what happens. For example, let's say I have a\n",
    "program to compute the perimeter of a rectangle (the sum of the length\n",
    "of all the edges). I have the following test cases:\n",

    "**Question:** What does it do?\n",

    "**Answer:** `number = number - 1` since that is following line and there are no indent changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What does it do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** It calculates number - 1, which is the current value of\n",
    "number (or 5) subtracts 1 from it, and makes that the new value\n",

    "**Question:** What is the next line?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Question:** What does it do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** It looks at the value of number, which is 4, and compares it to 1 and since `4 > 1` the while loop continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What is the next line?\n",

    "**Question:** What does it do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** It prints a second dot on the line.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Question:** What is the next line?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** No indent change so it is: `number = number - 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** And what does it do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** It talks the current value of number (4), subtracts 1 from it, which gives it 3 and then finally makes 3 the new value of number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What is the next line?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Since there is an indent change caused by the end of the while loop, the next line is: `while number > 1:`\n",
    "\n",

    "**Question:** What is the next line?\n",

    "**Answer:** It is: `number = number - 1`\n",

    "**Question:** What does it do?\n",

    "\n",
    "**Question:** What does it do?\n",

    "**Question:** What does it do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** It discovers the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. I'm joking. (I had to make sure you were awake.) The line prints a fourth dot on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What is the next line?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** It's: `number = number - 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What does it do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Takes the current value of number (2) subtracts 1 and makes 1 the new value of number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What is the next line?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Back up to the while loop: `while number > 1:`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What does the line do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** It compares the current value of number (1) to 1. Since `1 > 1` is false (one is not greater than one), the while loop exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What is the next line?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Since the while loop condition was false the next line is the line after the while loop exits, or: `print()`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What does that line do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Makes the screen go to the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Why doesn't the program print 5 dots?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The loop exits 1 dot too soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How can we fix that?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Make the loop exit 1 dot later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** And how do we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** There are several ways. One way would be to change the while loop to:\n",
    "`while number > 0:` . Another way would be to change the conditional to: `number >= 1` There are a couple others.\n",
