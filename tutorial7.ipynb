The `[` and `]` start and end the list with comma's (`,`) separating the list items. The list is used in `months[which_one - 1]`. A list consists of items that are numbered starting at 0. In other words if you wanted January you would type in 1 and that would have 1 subtracted off to use `months[0]`. Give a list a number and it will return the value that is stored at that location.\n",
