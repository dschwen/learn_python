    "(I skipped some of the output, but I think you get the idea.) So what does the program do? The first line import calendar uses a new command import. The command import loads a module (in this case the calendar module). To see the commands available in the standard modules either look in the library reference for python (if you downloaded it) or go to https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html. The calendar module is described in 8.2. If you look at the documentation it lists a function called prcal that prints a calendar for a year. The line `calendar.prcal(year)` uses the function. In summary to use a module import it and then use module\\_name.function for functions in the module. Another way to write the program is:\n"
