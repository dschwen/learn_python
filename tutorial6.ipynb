    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What happens next?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The line `return value` is run. This returns 3 from the function.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Where were we in mult(3, 2)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** We had the variables `a=3` and `b=2` and were examining\n",
    "the line `rest = mult(a, b - 1)` .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** So what happens now?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The variable rest get 3 assigned to it. The next line\n",
    "`value = a + rest` sets value to 3+3 or 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** So now what happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The next line runs, this returns 6 from the function. We are now\n",
    "back to running the line `print(\"3*2 = \", mult(3, 2))` which can now\n",
    "print out the 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What is happening overall?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Basically, we used two facts to calulate the multipule of the\n",
    "two numbers. The first is that any number times 0 is 0 (x * 0 =\n",
    "0). The second is that a number times another number is equal to the\n",
    "first number plus the first number times one less than the second\n",
    "number (x * y = x + x * (y - 1)). So what happens is 3*2 is\n",
    "first converted into 3 + 3*1. Then 3*1 is converted into\n",
    "3 + 3*0. Then we know that any number times 0 is 0 so 3*0\n",
    "is 0. Then we can calculate that 3 + 3*0 is 3 + 0 which\n",
    "is 3. Now we know what 3*1 is so we can calculate that\n",
    "3 + 3*1 is 3 + 3 which is 6.\n",
